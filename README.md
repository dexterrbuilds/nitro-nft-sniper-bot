# NITRO NFT Sniper Bot

A powerful tool for interacting with NFT contracts on various blockchain networks, with a focus on Base Chain and Ape Chain.

## Features

- Connect to blockchain networks via private key
- Interact with NFT contracts (mint, transfer, etc.)
- Schedule transactions for specific times
- Transaction history tracking
- Secure access key system to prevent unauthorized usage

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+ and npm
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nitro-nft-sniper-bot.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd nitro-nft-sniper-bot
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at http://localhost:8080.

## Access Key System

The NITRO NFT Sniper Bot uses a secure access key system to control who can use the application. This system is designed to prevent key sharing and ensure only authorized users can access the platform.

### For Users

- You need a valid access key to use the application
- Keys are bound to the device they're first used on and cannot be shared
- Keys expire after a set period (typically 30 days)
- To get an access key, visit our website or contact us directly

### For Administrators

Access the admin panel by navigating to `/admin` and logging in with the admin password. In the admin panel, you can:

- Generate new access keys
- Set expiration periods for keys
- View, copy, and delete existing keys
- Monitor key usage

## Security Implementation

The access key system uses several security measures:

1. **Device Fingerprinting**: Keys are bound to the specific device they're first used on
2. **Time-Limited Sessions**: Valid sessions expire after 24 hours, requiring re-validation
3. **Server Verification**: Keys are validated against a secure database
4. **Attempt Limiting**: Failed validation attempts are limited to prevent brute-force attacks

## Customizing the Access System

In a production environment, you should replace the simulated backend with a real server implementation:

1. Create a server API that validates keys against a secure database
2. Implement proper device fingerprinting using a library like FingerprintJS
3. Use a server-side session mechanism instead of localStorage
4. Add rate-limiting and IP blocking for suspicious activity
5. Implement proper administrator authentication

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory and can be deployed to any static hosting service.
